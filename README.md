# Diabetes Detection Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning Models

This project aims to build a predictive model for detecting diabetes based on a variety of clinical and demographic features. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, have been implemented. Additionally, a deep learning neural network has been developed using PyTorch to classify diabetes.
